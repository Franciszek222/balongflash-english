**Huawei Balong V7 modem and LTE router flashing utility.**

This program is used to flash BIN and EXE firmware files to device in download mode. It also supports flashing separate firmware components from selected directory. Firmware files could be extracted to separate files with header and without it. Both files with and without digital signature supported.

This is unofficial translated repo, there is other one with similiar name but it hasn't been updated since 2020.

**This utility can make your device unbootable!**  
Use it only if you fully understand all risks and consequences. In case of any issues, you're on your own. 
If you have bricked your device, use usbload utility from my other repo.
